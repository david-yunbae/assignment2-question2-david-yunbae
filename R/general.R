#' Queuing simulation
#'
#' @description This function allows you to put to test a first come, first serve queuing system. You decide how many people, how much service time they take and how many servers are available.
#'
#' @param Arrivals Input the whole column of the customers' arrival times.
#' @param ServiceTimes Input the whole column of the required service duration.
#' @param NumServers Input the number of total servers.
#'
#' @return A tibble of when each customers arrived, serving started and ended and which server was chosen.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples Multiserver(Arrivals = bank$arrival_time, ServiceTimes = bank$service_time, NumServers = 2)
#'

  # Feed customers through a multiserver queue system to determine each
  # customer's transition times.

  NumCust = length(Arrivals)  #  number of customer arrivals
  # When each server is next available (this will be updated as the simulation proceeds):
  AvailableFrom <- rep(0, NumServers)
  # i.e., when the nth server will next be available

  # These variables will be filled up as the simulation proceeds:
  ChosenServer <- ServiceBegins <- ServiceEnds <- rep(0, NumCust)

  # ChosenServer = which server the ith customer will use
  # ServiceBegins = when the ith customer's service starts
  # ServiceEnds = when the ith customer's service ends

  # This loop calculates the queue system's "Transitions by Customer":
  for (i in seq_along(Arrivals)){
    # go to next available server
    avail <-  min(AvailableFrom)
    ChosenServer[i] <- which.min(AvailableFrom)
    # service begins as soon as server & customer are both ready
    ServiceBegins[i] <- max(avail, Arrivals[i])
    ServiceEnds[i] <- ServiceBegins[i] + ServiceTimes[i]
    # server becomes available again after serving ith customer
    AvailableFrom[ChosenServer[i]] <- ServiceEnds[i]
