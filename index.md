# Welcome to 'Ex2' Multiserver package!

**As noted in the assignment prompt, this Github Pages is not directly the private assignment repo! I have included a copy of this md file in the private repo, so please inspect it! The file is named 'index.md'.**


## Installing my package
I have tested the installation and it worked. Except, the private repo denied access, so I ended up opening a personal public repo and cloning all the contents into it, then running the test. This means I can't possibly test the private repo at all. I will still hope you won't run into an unexpected error. Please copy and paste the below codes and run them line by line (these codes worked for me).


```markdown
library(devtools)
install_github("david-yunbae/assignment2-question2-david-yunbae")
```

### Jekyll Themes
