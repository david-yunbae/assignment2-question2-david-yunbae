Description: This is a very simple queuing system simulation based on a first come, first serve principle. 
  It generates outcomes based on varying number of customers, arrival times, service durations and even the 
  number of servers. The results allow you to discover how much waiting time it was on average, how much time 
  was saved on average by adding another server and much more.
